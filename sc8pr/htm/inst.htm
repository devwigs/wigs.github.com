<article><h1>Installation</h1>

<p>Please ensure that you have <a href="https://www.python.org">Python 3</a> installed before proceeding. Python versions 3.7 through 3.13 are suppported.</p>

<p>Next, open your terminal program (e.g. Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell). If you are installing <code>sc8pr</code> for all users you will likely need to run the terminal as an administrator. Make sure you have the latest versions of <code>pip</code> and <code>setuptools</code> by running the following command...
<pre class="Code">pip3 install -U pip setuptools</pre>
<p>On Windows, you may need to replace the command <code>pip3</code> at the beginning of the line by <code>py -3 -m pip</code> or specify a particular version of Python if more than one is installed: <code>py -3.10 -m pip</code>. If this still doesn’t work, locate the folder where Python is installed and use its <code>Scripts</code> folder as your current directory...</p>
<pre class="Code">cd "C:/Program Files/Python310/Scripts"
./pip3 install -U pip setuptools</pre>
<p>[Really old versions of Windows may require you to use a backslash instead of a forward slash.]</p>

<p>Finally, install <code>sc8pr</code>. This should check if <code>pygame</code> and other dependencies are already installed, and install them from <a class="Code" href="https://pypi.org/project/pygame/">PyPI</a> if neceessary.</p>

<p>To install all features including those with extra dependencies:</p>
<pre class="Code">pip3 install -U sc8prx</pre>
<p>To install core <code>sc8pr</code> features that depend only on <code>pygame</code>:</p>
<pre class="Code">pip3 install -U sc8pr</pre>

<p>If <code>pygame</code> is not already installed and <code>pip</code> cannot locate a build for your platform and Python version, you will need to install it manually before using <code>sc8pr</code>. Please visit the <a href="https://www.pygame.org"><code>pygame</code> website</a> if this happens.</p>
